# Bandcamp albums player

It allows playback of all albums, specified by comma-separated ids in the url hash segment.

Album id can be obtained from embedding code by visiting album page and clicking "Share / Embed" —> "Embed this album".

It looks like this: `<iframe style="…" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=`_2847966019_

Or you can just paste albums urls into textarea (one per line) and click "Make playlist".
If all albums ids are successfully retrieved, page will be reloaded with a new location hash.
